# Kcals

A minimalist Slack cli for when you don't want to quit your terminal to send one message.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i -g kcals
```

On the first use, Kcals will ask you a token, see here: [https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).

## Usage

```shell
$ kcals
```

## Todo

- fix config file creation (use ink)
- add gif to readme to show how it works
- take arguments to use as a command
