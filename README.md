A minimalist Slack cli for when you don't want to quit your terminal to send one message.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm i -g kcals
```

On the first use, Kcals will ask you a token, generate one here: [https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens).

## Usage

```shell
$ kcals
```

You can also give the receiver and message directly:

```shell
$ # kcals [receiver] [message]
$ kcals @romain hello how are you
```

If there is a single match with the name provided, the message will be sent directly.

You can also simply give the name of the receiver:

```shell
$ kcals @romain
```

## Todo

- fix display after config file creation (use ink)
- paste does not work
- support new line with cmd + enter?
